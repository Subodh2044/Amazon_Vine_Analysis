# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

The goal of this analysis is to analyze the reviews posted by the members of the paid Amazon Vine programs which allows manufacturers and publishers to receive the reviews. SellBy pays a fee to Amazon in exchange of providing products to Vine members, when are then required to publish a review. For the dataset that contains reviews for musical instruments, I leveraged PySpark for ETL process to extract, transform and Load to the pgAdmin, then analyzed data to determine any bias towards favorable reviews from the Vine members in the dataset.
